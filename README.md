# Face-Mask-Detection-Using-OpenCV-in-Python
This program resolves the human work by detecting the faces with/without mask by using Python OpenCV (Computer Vision) with the help of HAAR Cascade classifier.
However this is not the best method to Detect Face Masks. Machine Learning and Deep Learning Algorithms like "CNN" will be the most appropriate method for detecting face masks in python. I made of the use of the Cascade trainer GUI which is an open source GUI for Classifying the Datasets and converting them into .XML files. The accuracy of the output of this project will be based on the camera quality, datasets used, Cascade trainer GUI's classification, scaleFactor, brightness of the place etc.,
