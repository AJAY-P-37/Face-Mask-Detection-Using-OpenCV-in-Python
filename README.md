# Face-Mask-Detection-Using-OpenCV-in-Python
This program resolves the human work by detecting the faces with/without a mask by using Python OpenCV (Computer Vision) with the help of the Haar Cascade classifier function in Python. However, this is not as accurate as Machine Learning and Deep Learning Algorithms like "CNN" which is the appropriate method for detecting face masks with python. I used the Cascade trainer GUI ( https://amin-ahmadi.com/cascade-trainer-gui/ ), an open-source GUI for Classifying the Datasets and converting them into XML files. The accuracy of the output of this project will be based on the camera quality, datasets used, Cascade trainer GUI's classification, scaleFactor, brightness of the place, etc.,
